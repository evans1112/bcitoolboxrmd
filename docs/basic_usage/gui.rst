`Model Fitting <https://bci-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modelfit/index.html>`_
------------------------

The BCI Toolbox provides a variety of model fitting options, including **discrete data fitting** and **continuous data fitting**. It is structured to accommodate various stages of data analysis, from initial import to final visualization. 

**Key Features:**

1. *Import/Open File*: This feature allows users to seamlessly upload behavioral data. The interface supports importing single or multiple .csv files, catering to a range of data set sizes and complexities.

2. *Settings*: Users can access a variety of settings to configure the data fitting process. This includes specifying the number of simulations, selecting fit types, and adjusting various parameters relevant to the behavioral data analysis.

3. *Visualization*: Post-analysis, the interface offers robust visualization tools. Users can generate graphs and charts to better understand the fitted data.

4. *RDM*: Post-analysis, the interface offers robust visualization tools. Users can generate model's RDMs based on the fitting results.

`Model Simulation <https://bci-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modelsimu/index.html>`_
----

The BCI Toolbox allows users to engage in detailed simulations based on various model parameters, offering a comprehensive and interactive experience in understanding and analyzing sensory information. It provides a variety of options, including **1-D continuous simulation**, **2-D continuous simulation**, **discrete simulation** and other simulations for specific tasks.

**Key Features:**

1. *Parameters*: Users can set essential parameters for the simulation model. These parameters are fundamental in shaping the behavior and outcomes.

2. *Elements*: The toolbox provides a visual representation of key simulation elements, including **Response Distribution**, **Stimulus Encoding**, and **Prior Distribution**, enhancing the understanding of the model simulation process.

3. *Strategies*: Users have the option to select from various strategies like **Model Averaging**, **Model Selection**, and **Probability Matching**, each offering a different approach to sensory simulation.
